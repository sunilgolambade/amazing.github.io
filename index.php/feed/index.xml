<p>Well it’s been awhile between posts &#8211; and I’m sure most of you will have picked up that Good Design Makes Me Happy isn’t posting any new work.</p>



<p>I started Good Design Makes Me Happy with the endeavour to create a visual diary of beautiful graphic design &#8211; and have done so, having blogged for over 7 years. Having been on a hiatus for the past year, I have made the extremely tough decision to stop posting on the blog. It’s been such a hard decision and a wonderful experience posting, interacting with you all, sourcing and being inspired by such incredible work from all around the world.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img loading="lazy" width="819" height="1024" src="./../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/eb7147103984155.5f58fb3d5bbeb-819x1024.jpg" alt="" data-id="232" data-full-url="./../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/eb7147103984155.5f58fb3d5bbeb.jpg" data-link="./../../index.html?attachment_id=232" class="wp-image-232" srcset="./../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/eb7147103984155.5f58fb3d5bbeb-819x1024.jpg 819w, ./../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/eb7147103984155.5f58fb3d5bbeb-240x300.jpg 240w, ./../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/eb7147103984155.5f58fb3d5bbeb-768x960.jpg 768w, ./../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/eb7147103984155.5f58fb3d5bbeb.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px" /></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p><br>All good things must come to an end… Or not so much an end in this respect, but a break as such. Good Design Makes me Happy has been my personal visual diary for the last 7(!) years, and looking back on the archives makes me extremely happy, and so inspired. But in saying that, I&#8217;m in need of a rest from daily blogging, to analyse where to spend efforts and energy.</p>

<p>You know website speed matters.</p>



<p>Any time you try to pull up a website on your phone and it takes longer than a couple seconds to load, you click away. Who has time to wait for a slow website when you could be playing Candy Crush or scrolling Twitter?</p>



<p>You also know your visitors are the same way. You don’t want to lose people over slow loading times. When it comes to your WordPress website’s speed, one of the most important choices you’ll make is your hosting provider.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-rounded"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="./../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/78f4a385896dc9bc8c13e2960a21d212-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-229" srcset="./../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/78f4a385896dc9bc8c13e2960a21d212-1024x576.jpg 1024w, ./../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/78f4a385896dc9bc8c13e2960a21d212-300x169.jpg 300w, ./../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/78f4a385896dc9bc8c13e2960a21d212-768x432.jpg 768w, ./../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/78f4a385896dc9bc8c13e2960a21d212.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Shared hosting – With a shared hosting plan, your website shares a server with a number of other websites. This makes it more affordable for smaller websites that don’t get that much traffic. But if your site starts to get more traffic, you could start to strain the amount of resources available to you on the shared server.<br>Cloud hosting – Cloud hosting is when your hosting plan taps into a network of potentially unlimited virtual machines. It offers versatility and room for growth, and is good for any websites with inconsistent traffic.<br>VPS hosting – VPS hosting is a step up from shared hosting. You’ll still share a server with other websites, but fewer websites will be on the server and you’ll each have part of it sectioned off for your website only.<br>Dedicated server – For websites that are complex and/or get a lot of traffic, a dedicated server ensures you don’t have to share with anyone. All of the server’s resources go to your website alone.<br>Managed WordPress hosting – Managed WordPress hosting can technically fall into any of these other categories. It’s notable for being configured specifically for WordPress sites, meaning the web host takes care of maintenance tasks like updates.</p>

<p>In today’s digital world, how best would you define creativity and digital design? Most of us would come close to the suitable answer. Designers these days are expected to have a mix of both creativity and digitization, in their designs. The prerequisite for the designers to achieve this objective is a good design tool. Staying with UX and UI design, we have seen Adobe XD and Sketch, coming out as the most preferred though Adobe XD is relatively new while UX Sketch has been around for a while. Let’s get deeper into them and find out where they score over each other.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="300" src="./../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/640d4a6e1624be7febd0556236d8f8ee.png" alt="" data-id="226" data-full-url="./../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/640d4a6e1624be7febd0556236d8f8ee.png" data-link="./../../index.html?attachment_id=226" class="wp-image-226" srcset="./../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/640d4a6e1624be7febd0556236d8f8ee.png 400w, ./../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/640d4a6e1624be7febd0556236d8f8ee-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p><br>The demand for UX / UI designers continues to grow. 2019 is no different as it sees a phenomenal prospect. However, there is also a healthy debate which continues on concluding, which amongst the two more prominent designing tools in use, will win as the most preferred tool for Designers in the year 2019 and beyond. In fact, from research to complete an entire design, many UX designing tools needs for an ux designers. If you’re an apple mac os user then you can use the sketch, a popular, streamlined vector graphics editor with limitless plugins that is quickly becoming an industry standard, unless you have an apple machine your simply left out. After years of absence adobe aggressively comes with Adobe experience design (Adobe XD)</p>

It’s a fair question, outside of tech the concept of UX is fairly unknown.<br>Sometimes, I have a conversation, other times I just say I’m a graphic or web designer. That usually leads to people asking me to build their website for $50.00 or make them a logo. It’s all give and take. That being said, having answered the question more than a few times in my life I’ve noticed many people have strong misconceptions of what it takes to be a UX designer. Maybe it’s the way I explain it. After explaining many people think it’s easy to get into UX and that it’s something they’d also like to pursue. But, should they really?</p>
