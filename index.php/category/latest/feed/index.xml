It’s a fair question, outside of tech the concept of UX is fairly unknown.<br>Sometimes, I have a conversation, other times I just say I’m a graphic or web designer. That usually leads to people asking me to build their website for $50.00 or make them a logo. It’s all give and take. That being said, having answered the question more than a few times in my life I’ve noticed many people have strong misconceptions of what it takes to be a UX designer. Maybe it’s the way I explain it. After explaining many people think it’s easy to get into UX and that it’s something they’d also like to pursue. But, should they really?</p>
