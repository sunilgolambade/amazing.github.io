This makes it more affordable for smaller websites that don\u2019t get that much traffic. But if your site starts to get more traffic, you could start to strain the amount of resources available to you on the shared server.<br>Cloud hosting \u2013 Cloud hosting is when your hosting plan taps into a network of potentially unlimited virtual machines. It offers versatility and room for growth, and is good for any websites with inconsistent traffic.<br>VPS hosting \u2013 VPS hosting is a step up from shared hosting. You\u2019ll still share a server with other websites, but fewer websites will be on the server and you\u2019ll each have part of it sectioned off for your website only.<br>Dedicated server \u2013 For websites that are complex and\/or get a lot of traffic, a dedicated server ensures you don\u2019t have to share with anyone. All of the server\u2019s resources go to your website alone.<br>Managed WordPress hosting \u2013 Managed WordPress hosting can technically fall into any of these other categories. It\u2019s notable for being configured specifically for WordPress sites, meaning the web host takes care of maintenance tasks like updates.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You know website speed matters.
